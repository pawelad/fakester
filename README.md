Have you ever wanted to rickyroll your boss but found out that links
like [goo.gl/ejKmN3][rickyroll goo.gl],
[bit.ly/LEcVV7][rickyroll bit.ly] and (*ekhm*)
[youtu.be/I6OXjnBIW-4][rickyroll youtu.be] were way too obvious? Well,
I did. A couple of times actually, but he obviously knew what was coming
when he saw those coming from me.

So I made this. And now you can trick your boss too. Your welcome.

Feel free to use, ask, fork, star, report bugs, fix them,
suggest enhancements and point out any mistakes.

## Linked domains
Domains are meant to be interchangeable - I bought current ones for 2 cents each (while drunk), and will probably change them when they expire.
One redirect works on all domains.

Currently linked domains:
- http://amishweekly.xyz
- http://deepersteeper.xyz
- http://estrogenesis.xyz
- http://funkinthetrunk.xyz
- http://fuzzfeet.xyz
- http://isitstd.xyz
- http://masterexploder.xyz
- http://momcorp.xyz
- http://mortifex.xyz
- http://mrmeeseeks.xyz
- http://notporn.xyz
- http://spottieottiedopaliscious.xyz
- http://thedeuce.xyz
- http://thefiggisagency.xyz
- http://theflabbergaster.xyz
- http://thekrappinger.xyz
- http://uphole.xyz

## Malicious redirects
Please contact me if you found a redirect that was malicious. I realize
that this can possibly be used in such way - it's the opposite of my 
intentions, and I try to prevent that in a couple of ways but
(unfortunately) nothing is perfect.
