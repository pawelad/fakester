Have you ever wanted to rickyroll your boss but found that links like
[goo.gl/ejKmN3](https://goo.gl/ejKmN3), [bit.ly/LEcVV7](https://bit.ly/LEcVV7)
and (*ekhm*) [youtu.be/I6OXjnBIW-4](https://youtu.be/I6OXjnBIW-4) were way too
obvious? Well, I did. A couple of times actually.

So I made this. And now you can trick your boss too. You're welcome.

Last seen at [fakester.pawelad.xyz][fakester] (and all 
domains listed below).

## Domains
Domains are meant to be interchangeable - I bought current ones for 2 cents
each and will probably change them when they expire. Each redirect works on 
all domains.

Currently linked domains:
- https://badsoftware.review/
- https://doubledouce.club/
- https://farnsworth.science/
- https://forgettable.men/
- https://momcorp.science/
- https://mortifex.tech/
- https://notarickyroll.website/
- https://notarobot.date/
- https://notbigon.faith/
- https://realshark.loan/
- https://sugarlumps.trade/
- https://totallyreal.accountant/

Feel free to contact me and 'donate' new ones : -)

## Malicious redirects
Please contact me if you found a redirect that was malicious, as I realize that 
this can possibly be used in such way. It's the opposite of my intentions
and I try to prevent that in a couple of ways but (unfortunately) nothing is 
perfect.

## Contributions
Package source code is available at [GitHub][github].

Feel free to use, ask, fork, star, report bugs, fix them, suggest enhancements,
add functionality and point out any mistakes. Thanks!

Also, take a look [here][fakester running locally] if you want to run Fakester
locally.

## Tests
Package was tested with the help of `py.test` and `tox` on Python 3.4, 3.5
and 3.6 with Django 1.11 (see `tox.ini`).

Code coverage is available at [Coveralls][coveralls].

To run tests yourself you need to set environment variable with Django secret
key before running `tox` inside the repository:

```shell
$ export SECRET_KEY='...'
$ pip install tox
$ tox
```
