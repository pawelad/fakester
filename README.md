Have you ever wanted to rickyroll your boss but found that links like
[goo.gl/ejKmN3](https://goo.gl/ejKmN3), [bit.ly/LEcVV7](https://bit.ly/LEcVV7)
and (*ekhm*) [youtu.be/I6OXjnBIW-4](https://youtu.be/I6OXjnBIW-4) were way too
obvious? Well, I did. A couple of times actually.

So I made this. And now you can trick your boss too. You're welcome.

Last seen at [fakester.pawelad.xyz](https://fakester.pawelad.xyz) (and all 
domains listed below).

## Domains
Domains are meant to be interchangeable - I bought current ones for 2 cents
each and will probably change them when they expire. Each redirect works on 
all domains.

Currently linked domains:
- http://amishweekly.xyz

Feel free to contact me and 'donate' new ones : -)

## Malicious redirects
Please contact me if you found a redirect that was malicious, as I realize that 
this can possibly be used in such way. It's the opposite of my intentions
and I try to prevent that in a couple of ways but (unfortunately) nothing is 
perfect.

## Running locally
Fakester uses environment variables to manage configuration variables and you need
at least `SECRET_KEY` set (either explicitly or in `.env` file) to run it
locally.

It's run in production with the help of `dokku`, `gunicorn` and `whitenoise`,
which means it's Heroku/Foreman/Honcho (and Procfile in general) compatible
and can be run with one simple command of your choice:

```shell
$ export SECRET_KEY='...'
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ python fakester/manage.py migrate
$ heroku local web
$ ...
$ foreman start
$ ...
$ honcho start
$ ...
```

You can also run it as a regular Django project, via `manage.py runserver`:

```shell
$ export SECRET_KEY='...'
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ python fakester/manage.py migrate
$ python fakester/manage.py runserver
```

## Configuration
Fakester uses `python-decouple` and `dj-database-url` to manage configuration
variables. You can have a look at the settings file to see what values are
configurable, but for reference here are the ones that I use locally:

```shell
$ cat .env
SECRET_KEY='...'
DEBUG=True
DATABASE_URL='postgres://localhost/fakester'
RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY='...'
RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY='...'
```

## Contributions
Package source code is available at [GitHub][github].

Feel free to use, ask, fork, star, report bugs, fix them, suggest enhancements,
add functionality and point out any mistakes. Thanks!

## Tests
Package was tested with the help of `py.test` and `tox` on Python 3.4, 3.5
and 3.6 with Django 1.10 (see `tox.ini`).

Code coverage is available at [Coveralls][coveralls].

To run tests yourself you need to set environment variable with Django secret
key before running `tox` inside the repository:

```shell
$ pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
$ export SECRET_KEY='...'
$ tox
```
