Have you ever wanted to rickroll your boss but found that links like
https://goo.gl/ejKmN3, https://bit.ly/LEcVV7 and (_ekhm_) https://youtu.be/I6OXjnBIW-4
were _a bit_ too obvious? Well, I did. A couple of times, actually.

So I made this. And now you can trick your boss too. You're welcome.

Currently, there are no other domains linked (but feel free to donate one : ).

## Malicious redirects
Please [open an issue][github new issue] if you found a redirect that was malicious,
as I realize that this can possibly be used in such way. It's the opposite of my
intentions and I try to prevent that in a couple of ways but (unfortunately) nothing
is perfect.
