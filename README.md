Have you ever wanted to rickyroll your boss but found that links like
[goo.gl/ejKmN3](https://goo.gl/ejKmN3), [bit.ly/LEcVV7](https://bit.ly/LEcVV7)
and (*ekhm*) [youtu.be/I6OXjnBIW-4](https://youtu.be/I6OXjnBIW-4) were way too
obvious? Well, I did. A couple of times actually.

So I made this. And now you can trick your boss too. You're welcome.

## Domains
Domains are meant to be interchangeable - I bought current ones for 2 cents
each, and will probably change them when they expire. Each redirect works on 
all domains.

Currently linked domains:
- http://amishweekly.xyz
- http://deepersteeper.xyz
- http://estrogenesis.xyz
- http://funkinthetrunk.xyz
- http://fuzzfeet.xyz
- http://isitstd.xyz
- http://masterexploder.xyz

## Malicious redirects
Please contact me if you found a redirect that was malicious, as I realize that 
this can possibly be used in such way. It's the opposite of my intentions,
and I try to prevent that in a couple of ways but (unfortunately) nothing is 
perfect.

## Tests
Package was tested with the help of `py.test` and `tox` on Python 3.4, 3.5
and 3.6 (see `tox.ini`).

Code coverage is available at [Coveralls][coveralls].

To run tests yourself you need to set environment variable with Django secret
key before running `tox` inside the repository:

```shell
$ pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
$ export DJANGO_SECRET_KEY='...'
$ tox
```

## Contributions
