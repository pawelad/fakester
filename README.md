Have you ever wanted to rickroll your boss but found that links like
https://goo.gl/ejKmN3, https://bit.ly/LEcVV7 and (_ekhm_) https://youtu.be/I6OXjnBIW-4
were _a bit_ too obvious? Well, I did. A couple of times, actually.

So I made this. And now you can trick your boss too. You're welcome.

## Domains
Domains are meant to be interchangeable (with each redirect working on all currently
linked domains) and temporary (renewing a domain is usually much more expensive
than registering it).

Currently linked domains:

- https://reportech.xyz/
- https://mortifex.shop/
- https://notarickroll.website/

If you'd like to 'donate' a domain, [let me know][github new issue]! It's as easy
as pointing the DNS record at `fakester.pawelad.me` and enabling it on the backend.

### Historical domains
Just for the sake of it, here are domains used in the past:

## Malicious redirects
Please [open an issue][github new issue] if you found a redirect that was malicious,
as I realize that this can possibly be used in such way. It's the opposite of my
intentions and I try to prevent that in a couple of ways but (unfortunately) nothing
is perfect.
